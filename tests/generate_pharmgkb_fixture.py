"""Generate a tiny synthetic PharmGKB clinical-annotations dump for tests.

Produces two TSVs that mirror real PharmGKB structure:
  - clinical_annotations.tsv: one row per clinical annotation
  - clinical_ann_alleles.tsv: per-genotype rows linked by Clinical Annotation ID

The synthetic genotypes line up with the MyHappyGenes mock fixture's known
SNPs, so end-to-end `analyze` tests on the MHG fixture will fire on
known-carrier rows.

Usage:
    python tests/generate_pharmgkb_fixture.py

# Per-genotype annotations: clinical_annotation_id, genotype, annotation_text,

# so the end-to-end analyze tests trigger expected matches.
# v0.6.1 fixture correction (ADR-0017): real PharmGKB populates `Allele
# Function` ONLY on haplotype rows (*1, *2, *15:02). SNV rows have it empty
# on every row. Earlier fixture revisions inverted this and concealed the
# v0.6.0 regression — see CHANGELOG. The fixture now models real shape:
#   - SNV genotype rows (AA, AG, etc.): Allele Function = ""
#   - Haplotype rows (*1/*2 etc.): Allele Function populated (but those
#     rows are dropped by `_normalize_genotype`, so they never reach the
#     classifier — they exist here only to model PharmGKB's actual dump).
