"""End-to-end integration: full analyze pipeline against the mock generators.

ADR-0015: the mock generators are the contract for what real data looks
like. The pipeline (parse → annotate → render) must produce a known,
human-vetted set of annotations against generator output. Any divergence
needs a code+ADR review, not a silent test update.

This is the gate that would have caught the v0.4.2 indel-anchor incident
and the v0.5.0 PharmGKB non-finding / somatic incidents BEFORE shipping,
had it existed earlier. Adding it now so future regressions can't sneak
through.
