"""Mock-data-as-spec invariants (ADR-0015).

The mock data generators define what real source data looks like. Code that
operates on parser output must work against the GENERATED fixtures. Fixtures
that don't represent the real-world format silently hide categorical bugs
(see the v0.4.2 indel-anchor incident, where the MHG mock generator put
"CTT"/"C" at rs113993960 — a multi-base genotype that no real array
produces — and the ClinVar carrier rule appeared correct in tests while
emitting hundreds of false positives in production).

These tests pin invariants the generator output MUST satisfy. If a check
here fails, the generator is wrong and needs fixing (or, rarely, the
invariant itself is wrong and ADR-0015 needs amending).
