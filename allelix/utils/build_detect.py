"""Genome build detection from position data.

ADR-0021: Allelix detects the build of an input genotype file from a
handful of well-known SNP positions rather than trusting the file header.
A real-world MyHappyGenes/Tempus file was confirmed to label its build
as "37.1" while shipping GRCh38 coordinates; cross-build REF/ALT
comparison produced a false-positive pathogenic call on NIPA1.

The detection table holds authoritative (chromosome, 1-based position)
pairs for all three builds (GRCh36, GRCh37, GRCh38) across ~10 SNPs
spread over chromosomes 1, 10, 11, 12, 17, 19, and 22. Each entry's positions
differ by tens of thousands to millions of bases — there is no
ambiguity. A single matched rsID identifies the build; multiple are
confirmatory.

Position data is normative; headers are not.
