"""Strand flipping, complement logic, and ambiguous-SNP detection.

A SNP read on the reverse strand has its alleles complemented (A↔T, C↔G).
Two databases reporting the "same" variant on opposite strands will list
opposite allele letters. For most SNPs this is unambiguous and reversible.
For A/T and C/G SNPs (palindromic), the complement equals the alternative —
so a strand-flip is undetectable from sequence alone and is best handled by
extra information (allele frequency, surrounding context).

ADR-0010 documents the design.
