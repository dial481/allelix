# Architecture Decision Records

This directory holds the design decisions that shape Allelix.

Each ADR captures one decision: the context that forced it, what we chose, and the consequences. ADRs are immutable — if a decision changes, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one rather than editing history.

## Writing a new ADR

1. Copy the latest ADR as a starting structure.
2. Pick the next number in sequence.
3. Status is `Accepted` when merged. Mark as `Superseded by ADR-NNNN` if a later ADR replaces the decision.
4. Add it to the index above.
5. If it supersedes an earlier ADR, update both the old ADR's status and its index entry.

Keep them short. ADRs are reading material for contributors, not novels.
